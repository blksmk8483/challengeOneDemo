# # Module 1 Challenge
-01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
- In this first challenge I looked at the accessibility of the HTML and structure of the CSS.
- For the HTML, I updated the title to better reflect the website name.
- Also, the HTML elements were updated to help search engines and browsers use and render the page.
- This will overall help SEO performance and help with accessiblity to users.
- In CSS I added two new class tags (class=main-content and benefit-item) to help group some of the redundant processes.
- Also, in CSS I reorganized the (a and p tags) under the (body tag) for better organization.

- In the future I hope to add even more SEO tags to further promote websites.
